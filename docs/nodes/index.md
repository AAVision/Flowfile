# Nodes Overview

Flowfile's nodes are the building blocks of your data pipelines. Each node performs a specific operation on your data, and by connecting them together, you can create complex data transformations without writing code.

Our nodes are organized into five main categories:

- **Input Nodes**: Load data from various sources into your flow
- **Transform Nodes**: Modify and shape your data
- **Combine Nodes**: Merge or join multiple datasets
- **Aggregate Nodes**: Summarize and group your data
- **Output Nodes**: Save or visualize your results

Each node is designed to be intuitive and follows a consistent pattern:
- Clear inputs and outputs
- Visual feedback on data flow
- Preview capability to check results
- Error handling and validation
